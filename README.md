Hello Creatures of the Betweens!

In the Outworld, I am Maerian Morris, and I am a dog-herder and artist who likes to pull together disparate elements to create doorways into other worlds.

I have absolutely no idea how to code but have this inkling that learning how might be wise.
So here I am.

I look forward to seeing what might be next.
